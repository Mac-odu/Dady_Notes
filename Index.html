    <h3>LECTURES TO TRAIN AND ORDAIN WORKERS AND LEADERS</h3>
    <p>Matthew 15:14 (1-14),</p>
    <p>14 Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind, both will fall into a ditch.”</p>
    <p>Luke 6:39(6-39)</p>
    <p>39 And He spoke a parable to them: “Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into the ditch?</p>
    <p>Leaders are needed every time and everywhere because of followers. Yet we see more bad leaders(blind) than good.</p>
    <p>Jesus referred to the Pharisees and the teachers as blind leaders whose GUIDANCE (leadership or government) will lead their followers into a pit (failure, disaster)</p>

        THE CHURCH (2 TYPES)
        In which we have been chosen to work is so complex to understand, however, we need to compare the New Testament Church to the Old Testament Church to gain insight and wisdom to enable one to lead in any local church. 
        Hebrews 3:1-6, 12-14; 8:1-7, 13; 9:1-10, 11-15; 12:18-24; 1 Corinthians 10:1-13
        1.	Old Testament. The church in the wilderness
        2.	New Testament. The Body of Christ (Mount Zion, The General Assembly, Church of the first born)
        You going to be workers and leaders who are to function for the progression and success of your local assembly, therefore, training becomes necessary for able and effective leadership.

        -	1 Corinthians 3:9-11
        -	Ephesians 4:11-16
        
        DESCRIPTION OF LEADERSHIP IN THE CHURCH
        “METAPHORS”
        They are used to capture and explain spiritual truths and concepts for the understanding of the reader of the Holy Scriptures.
        I.	THE MASTER: JESUS CHRIST.
        •	SERVANT: LUKE 12:37-38; Born servants (Children of Gibcomtes), Bought servants, hired servants Mark 3:13-15; Philippians 2:5-11 to occupy leadership (Elders and Deacons) positions, Luke 6:39-42; Dealing with your plank Luke 12:41-48. Key: Faithful, Wise, Will
        •	HOUSEHOLD
        •	SHEPHERD. John 10:1-8(New Testament)
        They are Pastors and Elders; they are LEADERS and MANAGERS.
        
        SHEPHERD (Elder/Pastor)- SERVANT
        (Deacons / Deaconess/ Disciples) relationship. John 13:12-17

        They require faultless character, spiritual maturity and a willingness to serve humbly.
